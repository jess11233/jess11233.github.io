                <h3>Introduction: </h3>
                <p>For this project I choose the Annual Wasted Fuel Due to Congestion dataset from the bureau of transporation statistics. I believe that this topic
                    is important because americans should to be aware of how much resources and money are wasted on just congestion on the road. In this dataset it
                    documents the amount of wasted fuel per year (1982-2020), the area, and the type of population group.

                <h3>Story Telling: </h3>
                <p>The scatter chart I created is supposed to compare the amount of fuel wasted in 2020 with the short-term congestion rankings of various cities. 
                    This visualization revealed that, while most U.S. cities experienced a significant reduction in fuel waste in 2020 due to decreased travel during 
                    the pandemic, a few large urban areas still wasted substantial amounts of fuel. This situation underscores the ongoing challenge of congestion in major
                    metropolitan areas and highlights that even in unusual circumstances like COVID-19, showing that the economic and environmental costs of traffic 
                    congestion will not be easy to eliminate.
