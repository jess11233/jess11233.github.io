                <h3>Summary: </h3>
                <p>For this project I choose the Annual Wasted Fuel Due to Congestion dataset from the bureau of transporation statistics. I believe that this topic
                    is important because americans should to be aware of how much resources and money are wasted on just congestion on the road. In this dataset it
                    documents the amount of wasted fuel per year (1982-2020), the area, and the type of population group. This project has four main visualizations, 
                    the first one being the amount of fuel wasted during the pandemic to demonstrate how even during a crisis that fuel was still wasted due to congestion. 
                    Next I made a visualization of fuel waste by population groups over time to show that a possile solution to wasted fuel could be an investment in public 
                    transportation for large urban areas. Next I made a visualization of the top ten urban areas and how much fuel they wasted and the top reason for congestion 
                    in mot of these areas is work. From my chart I explained how a possible solution to this is increased remote working and or carpolling togther. In my last chart
                    I compared long-term percentage change to the 2020 fuel waste. This last chart directly compared to my first visualization but showing teh long term change this 
                    time, the possible solution I made from this chart is adopting a more environmentlly conscious approach to transportation.
