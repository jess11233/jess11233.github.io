            <p>Hello I my name is Jesse Schefers and I am a senior at UNC Charlotte majoring in computer science with a consentation in information technology.
            In my free time I like to go to the gym, play tennis, and I also do classical lao dancing. My plans after graduating is to get a job and try to 
            go traveling around the world. Over the summer I worked as an QA engineer intern where I did a lot of software testing and ultize an 
            Selenium-based automation tool, to test web application functionality in a fast-paced development environment with frequent code updates.
