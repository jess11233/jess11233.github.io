                <p> 
                    For this project, I used a dataset that analyzed medical insurance. I thought this would be a great dataset to use for regression modeling because it is a beneficial
                    topic to predict with. My goal for this project is to understand and predict what personal and lifestyle factors most influence medical insurance costs. In the first
                    experiment, I used a basic linear regression then for my second experiment, I used a modified version with BMIÂ², and lastly for my third experiment, I made a ridge
                    regression model. For all of my experiments, I got a similar accuracy, explaining about 78% of the cost variation. The results showed that major factors like BMI,
                    age, and smoking habits have the strongest influence on insurance charges.
