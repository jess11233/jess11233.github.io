                <p> 
                For this project, I chose a dataset about global economic indicators to see what countries would be classified into a slow, moderate, or fast growth categories. 
                I did this because I wanted to see what makes some countries' economic growth faster than others, and if there are some economic indicators they share. For my first 
                visual, I showed the distribution of growth classes. This is visual shows how many countries fall into each group, providing a big-picture view before analysing more. 
                The second chart compares GDP per capita and inflation rates, with the percentages colored by growth class. This shows that fast-growth countries often have higher 
                GDP per capita and stable inflation, while slow-growth countries tend to face higher inflation rates. After the visuals, I trained a random forest model to identify 
                important predictors like GDP growth and population size. The model had a high accuracy, demonstrating that these indicators can be noticed between different growth 
                categories. I also used a decision tree model to provide a simpler structure that shows how factors like GDP growth and population are important to classify a country. 
                Overall, my project suggests that factors like stable inflation and increasing income levels correlate with faster economic growth.
