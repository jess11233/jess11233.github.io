                <p> 
                For this project I chose a dataset about global economic indicators to see what countries would be classified into slow, moderate,
                 or fast growth. I did this because I wanted to see what make some coutries econmic growth faster than others and if there are some econmic
                  indicator they share. For my first chart I showed the distribution of growth classes. This is supposed highlights how many countries
                   fall into each group, giving a big-picture view before analysing more. The second chart compares GDP per capita and inflation rates, 
                   with the percentages colored by growth class. This shows that fast-growth countries often have higher GDP per capita and stable inflation, 
                   while slow-growth countries tend to face higher inflation rates. Finally, I built a Random Forest model to predict a countryâ€™s growth class 
                   using these indicators. The model reached good accuracy, showing that factors like GDP and inflation can reliably separate slow, moderate, 
                   and fast growth countries. The main takeaway is that keeping inflation stable and supporting income growth are strong signals of a faster growing economy.
