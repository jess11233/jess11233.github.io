        <img src="images/review1.png" alt="peer review image of their website">
        <a href="https://cpeter66.github.io/itis3135/project/photography%20club%20project/index.html">Link to their website</a>
        

        <h3>General</h3>
        
        <p>The main page is named index.html which is all that is required to be done. 
            Some suggestions for improvement would be the fix the files, they have a file for 
            their index page which I think it would be simplier to just have that straight in 
            their project file to advoid confusion. I would also sugest putting hobbyscript.js in their
            scripts folder instead of straight in the project folder. Overall I think this is a good I would jsut suggest rearanging 
            the files.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>The design looks very offical I honest thought I was on an offical UNC Charlotte page, and I have no critics for it.</p>
        
        <h3>CRAP</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>constrast is good</li>
        <li>alignment is good</li>
        <li>proximity is good</li>
        <li>repitition is good</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Within the page</h3>
        <p>The page contains everything that it need (header, main, footer, and a nav bar)</p>

        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>header does not have name of website and does not have h1 in it.</p>

        <h3>Main</h3>
        <p>The main does not start with h2.</p>

        <h3>Tagline</h3>
        <p>I dont see a tagline though the logo is consistance and could possibly be considered a tagline</p>

        <h3>Footer</h3>
        <p>has the vaild button-links in the footer</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>This website meets almost all the requirements except the interactive elements dont work yet
            but after that it should have everything done.
