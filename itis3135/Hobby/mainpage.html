                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello my name is Jesse, and I do Lao dancing as one of my hobbies. Ive been doing this type of dancing for about a year now 
                    and want to personally get into other forms like ballet and jazz. Other hobbies I have is playing video games, tennis, and 
                    cooking / baking. For me dancing is a great way to get out of my comfort zone and try something new. It has helped me to find a 
                    community where I can express myself and connect with others.
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>I am currently a full time third-year student majoring in computer science with a consentration in information technology. 
                    While I'm not working toward my degree I like to practice dancing on the weekends with my group. I personally enjoy it because 
                    it with my major I am stuck inside a lot sitting down on my computer, but with dance I can get to go outside and move my body around 
                    while also socializing with others. 
                </p>

                <p><strong>About Lao dance</strong></p>
                <p>Lao dancing is form of dancing that orginated in Laos. There are many different types of Lao dancing the most common and tradional one being
                    called "Lamvong" meaing dance circle. The type of Lao dancing I do is a more modern Lao-american form of lao dancing.
                     Lao dance often reflects themes of nature and spirituality, and is performed during festivals and celebrations.  </p>

                <h2>Best Times for Dancing</h2>
                <p>The good thing about dance is that you can dance anytime you want!</p>
                <p>Personally I practice dancing on the weekends, which is when I am most free.</p>
                <h2>The different times to practice and there benefits:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> The morning is best for morning people who like to wake up in the morning.
                    If you like having a good physical start to the day this is the best time to practice.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Weekends:</strong> The weekends are best for people who work all week long and want to relax once they get back from work.
                    The weekend is also good for people who don't like to have a time restraint on how long they owuld like to practice, 
                or for people who are not good at keeping track of time.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Evening:</strong> The evening is best for people who like to do things at night. This time at the day is most likely 
                        going to be the busiest time of the day for this activity so it is perfect for the people who enjoy the social aspect of dancing. </li>

                <p>There are many different locations where you can practice and learn to dance. I personally like to practice at outside in 
                    my backyard on a sunny day, but if it rainy I will go inside and practice in the lving room. As a person who is indoors a lot 
                I like how dance gives me the opportunity to get outside and move my body.</p>
