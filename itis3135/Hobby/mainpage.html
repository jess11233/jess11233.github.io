                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello my name is Jesse, and I do lao dancing as one of my hobbies. Ive been doing this type of dancing for about a year now 
                    and want to personally get into other forms like ballet and jazz. Other hobbies I have is playing video games, tennis, and 
                    cooking / baking. For me dancing is a great way to get out of my comfort zone and try something new. It has helped me to find a 
                    community where I can express myself and connect with others.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently a full time third-year student majoring in computer science with a consentration in information technology. 
                    While I'm not working toward my degree I like to practice dancing on the weekends with my group. I personally enjoy it because 
                    it with my major I am stuck inside a lot sitting down on my computer, but with dance I can get to go outside and move my body around 
                    while also socializing with others. 
                </p>

                <h2>Best Times for Dancing</h2>
                <p>The good thing about dance is that you can dance anytime you want!</p>
                <p>Personally I practice dancing on the weekends, which is when I am most free.</p>
                <h2>The different times to practice and there benefits:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Morning:</strong> The morning is best for morning people who like to wake up in the morning.
                    If you like having a good physical start to the day this is the best time to practice.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Weekends:</strong> The weekends are best for people who work all week long and want to relax once they get back from work.
                    The weekend is also good for people who don't like to have a time restraint on how long they owuld like to practice, 
                or for people who are not good at keeping track of time.</li>
                
                    <li><strong>Evening:</strong> The evening is best for people who like to do things at night. This time at the day is most likely 
                        going to be the busiest time of the day for this activity so it is perfect for the people who enjoy the social aspect of dancing. </li>

                <p>There are many different way you can start dacning and it also depends on the type of dance you would like the learn.</p>
                <p>The most common way to get into dancing is to join a dance class. Though this method can be very expensive
                    and not always work for your schedule. Which is why I don't use this method of getting into dancing, I personally recommend first starting 
                    learning online on a free platform.
