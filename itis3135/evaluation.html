        <h2>User inyerface<h2>
            <p>User inyerface is a website that is a challenging exploration of
                user interactions and design patterns. The website is designed to be as challenging as 
                possible to navigate and confusing to the user. you are able to hover over objects yet are 
            unable to click on them.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: I would give the contrast a 4/5 because
                     it is easy to read and doesn't really have too much contrast </li>
                <li>Repitition: I would give the repetition a 3/5 because 
                    it doesnt have much on teh website to even repeat</li>
                <li>Alignment: The Alignment is a 2/5 becuase everything was centered and when you scrolled up
                the title seemed to merge into the top of the page.</li>
                <li>Proximity: I would give the proximity a 1/5 the main image merges into 
                the broswer bar and makes it hard to understand where on the page you are.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Final Assesment:</strong> Overall I would give this page a 10/20, it's not the worst page in the world 
            and I've probably made worse but it does have its fair share of problems. especially when it comes to using the hover function
        it is very confusing to its users. It does not follow the CRAP principles </p>

        <h2>Pinterest<h2>
            <p>pinterest is one of my favorite websites to use, it is an online platform for sharing and saving ideas, and 
                get inspiration from other users on the site.
                I like how it is very user friendly and easy it is to navigate throughout the site.
                pinterest is known for its easy UX and UI design. 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: I would give the contrast a 4/5 because it is easy to read and doesn't really have too much contrast 

                </li>
                <li>Repitition: The repetition depends on the users but overall I would give it a 
                    4/5 becuase the website does not repeat too much.
                </li>
                <li>Alignment: The Alignment is a 5/5 perfect. They fit all the photos
                    perfectly and the images are in the correct place.
                </li>
                <li>Proximity: I would also give the proximity a 5/5 because the photos will always fit within the 
                    page. with the perfect formats for the images it fit perfectly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Final Assesment:</strong> Overall I would give this page a 18/20, The website is known for its easy UX and UI design.
            All of its functions work very well and comes together very conhuently. I would say this site definitely fits the CRAP principles  </p>
