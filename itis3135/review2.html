        <p>
        I, Jesse Schefers agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2024 ITIS 3135 Web-Based Application Design & Development with my instructor, D. I. von Briesen.
             I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
             and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
              I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. 
             I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates' code directly. 
             I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
             and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. Jesse S. Schefers - (2/6/2025)
