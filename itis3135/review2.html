        <h3>General</h3>
        
        <p>Good layout, easy to navigate. Seems like it is imcomplete and needs more work but once it is all done 
            I'm sure it will be good. The Contact page doesn't work and has none of the interactive elements, also no images are used.
            Add those and then it should be good.
        </p>
        

        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p>very simple though it is easy to navigate. I suggest including accumulus</p>
        
        <h3>CRAP</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>constrast is good</li>
        <li>alignment could use some work</li>
        <li>proximity is good</li>
        <li>repitition is good</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Within the page</h3>
        <p>The page contains everything that it need (header, main, footer, and a nav bar)</p>

        <h3>Header</h3>
        <p>Header has everything that it need.</p>

        <h3>Main</h3>
        <p>Main meets all the requirements.</p>

        <h3>Tagline</h3>
        <p>No tagline at all so just add that to the header or main</p>

        <h3>Footer</h3>
        <p>has the vaild button-links in the footer</p>

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <p>This website meets almost all the requirements except the interactive elements dont work yet
            and one of the pages doesnt work, then need at least one image but after that it should be good.
        </p>
