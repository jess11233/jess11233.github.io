            <h2>Project overview</h2>
            <p>The application I am building for my client is going to be based around the
             "student who would like to learn about the basics of JavaScript, CSS or any other
             programming language." web-application stated in the project description. My client
             is a business student at UNCC, so I will be building this application for them and other businesses students
             to learn more about programming languages that are used a lot in a more business sense.</p>

            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>The content that this application will have is a home page, a page about diffferent types 
                of businesses and what programming languages are best for each type of business, a page about 
                programming languages, an example page with real-world projects, and a page with resource that are best for learning about programming languages.
            </p>
